            <h3><em>"To be a church where people experience the presence and power of God, not just religion."</em></h3>
                <p class="reference">- Dr. Timothy Cowin, Lead Pastor</p>

	    <h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
				<h3>Love God + Love People + Change the World!</h3>
				    <h4>The central focus of our fellowship is our shared, common mission to help people become followers of Jesus Christ. Christ-followers are people who are growing in three vital relationships in their lives, their</h4>
				<h3>Love for God, Love for People,</h3>
				    <h4>and their</h4>
				<h3>Connection with Godâ€™s mission in the world.</h3>
				    <h4>Jesus made it very clear that when our lives reflect the Great Commandments (Matthew 22.36-40) and the Great Commission (Matthew 28.18-20), we are fulfilling the heart of what it means to follow Him.&nbsp;</h4>
<!---CORE BELIEFS--->				   
		<hr width="60%"</hr>
		<h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">CORE BELIEFS</h1>
    <!---GOD--->
		    <span class="topic">GOD  </span><h4>God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe. He has eternally existed in three personalities: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three are co-equal and are one God.</h4>
		            <p class="reference">Genesis 1:1, 26, 27; 3:22 || Psalm 90:2 || Matthew 28:19 || 1 Peter 1:2 || 2 Corinthians 13:14</p>
    <!---You--->
		   <span class="topic">YOU  </span><h4>You are made in the spiritual image of God to be like Him in character. You are the supreme object of God's creation and love. Although you have tremendous potential for good, you are marred by an attitude of disobedience towards God called "sin." This attitude separates you from God until the relationship is restored through a personal commitment to Jesus Christ.</h4>
		           <p class="reference">Genesis 1:27 || Psalms 8:3-6 || Isaiah 53:6 || Romans 3:23 || Isaiah 59: 1-2</p>
    <!---Eternity--->
		   <span class="topic">ETERNITY  </span><h4>Humans were created to exist forever. We will either exist eternally separated from God by sin, or in union with God through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is Hell. To be eternally in union with Him is eternal life. Heaven and Hell are real places of eternal existence.</h4>
		           <p class="reference">John 3:16 || 1 John 2:25; 5:11-13 || Romans 6:23 || Revelation 20:15</p>
    <!---JESUS--->
		   <span class="topic">JESUS CHRIST  </span><h4>Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is co-equal with the Father. Jesus lived a sinless human life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all people by dying on a cross. He arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death.&nbsp;</h4>
		   <span class="description">We believe in the personal, bodily and glorious return of the Lord Jesus Christ and that His second coming inspires believers for dynamic and zealous life and service for Him while waiting for His return.</span>
		           <p class="reference">Matthew 1:22-23 || Isaiah 9:6 || John 1:1-5; 14:10-30 || Hebrews 4:14-15 || 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 || Romans 1:3-4 || Acts 1:9-11 || 2 Timothy 6:14-15 || Titus 2:13</p>
    <!---Salvation--->
		   <span class="topic">SALVATION  </span><h4>Salvation is a gift from God to humanity. We can never make up for our sin by self-improvement or good works.  Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God's offer of Forgiveness can we be saved from sin's penalty. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith.</h4>
		               <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Romans 6:23 || Ephesians 2:8-9 || John 14:6; 1:12 || Titus 3:5 || Galatians 3:26 || Romans 5:1</p>
    <!---Eternal Security--->
		   <span class="topic">ETERNAL SECURITY  </span><h4>Because God gives us eternal life through Jesus Christ, the believer is secure in that salvation for eternity. Salvation is maintained by the grace and power of God, not by the self-effort of the Christian. It is grace and keeping power of God that gives this security.  We believe that baptism by immersion and the Lord's Supper are ordinances to be practiced. They are, however, not to be regarded as means of salvation.</h4>
		           <p class="reference">John 10:29 || 2 Timothy 1:12 || Hebrews 7:25; 10:10-14 || 1 Peter 1:3-5</p>
    <!---The Holy Spirit--->
           <span class="topic">THE HOLY SPIRIT  </span><h4>The Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son as God. He is present in the world to make people aware of their need for Jesus Christ. 
               He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. We believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ and, during this age, convict men, 
               regenerate the believing sinner and indwell, guide, instruct, and empower the believer for godly living and service.The Christian seeks to live under His control daily.</h4>
                   <p class="reference">2 Corinthians 3:17 || John 16:7-13; 14:16-17 || Acts 1:8 || 2 Corinthians 2:12; 3:16 || Ephesians 1:13 Galatians 5:25 || Ephesians 5:18</p>
    <!---The Bible--->                  
           <span class="topic">THE BIBLE  </span><h4>The Bible is God's Word to all people. It was written by human authors under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. Because it is inspired by God, it is truth without error in the original writings.</h4>
                   <p class="reference">2 Timothy 3:16 || 2 Peter 1:20-21 || 2 Timothy 1:13 || Psalms 119:105, 160; 12:6 || Proverbs 30:51</p>
    <!---The Church--->
           <span class="topic">THE CHURCH  </span><h4>We believe that the true Church is composed of all such persons who, through saving faith in Jesus Christ, have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit and are united together in the body of Christ, of which He is the head.  We believe that Jesus Christ is the Lord and Head of the Church, and that every local church has the right, under Christ, to decide and govern its own affairs.</h4>
